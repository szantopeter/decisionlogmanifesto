    <h1>Principles of maintaining a decision log</h1>

    <p class="multiline principle">
      Decision logs should be in an easy to access shared location, 
      e.g.: Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Sharepoint Confluence or similar
    </p>
    <p class="multiline principle">
      The main audience of the decision log is the author. 
      By the time it is written the author will have a really
      good understanding of the subject.
    </p>
    <p class="multiline principle">
      The secondary audience of the decision log is anyone reading it. 
      Be realistic, the longer, more detailed it is, the less likely people will read it.
    </p>
    <p class="multiline principle">
      The simples way to select the winning option is to choose the one with the most positive result.
      If required a scoring system can be introduced with different weight per criteria.
